# Clear Skin Guide
In this Project I created a website for my girlfriend, where she acts as a guide in skincare.
this project was very difficult to implement. I avoided Bootstrap because Ifound that it requires a too deep Knolwedge before I can use it. I also found a page where are listed alot of Bootstrap bugs, it put me completely off using it

## Header and Footer
By far the most diffucult part of the project. I wanted them to resize according to media width, it took countless tries and error. 
the Website name serves as link to the homepage, the links to the other pages are on aseparate line up to breakpoint width 550px, where they form one line with the home link;
In the footer,the disclaimer and social link list are hidden and made visible by clicking/tapping on their respective header and symbol. At breakpoint width 550px, the disclaimer and social links are fully visible.
The social links pop-up had a problem after another: unintended spaces beteween list items, hard to center the icons, it wouldn tap on mobile devices at the beginning.
The Social Pages links only go as far as the home page of their respective destinations.
The query form in the how to page was decided and implemented at last minute because there was plenty of space available in the "How to..?" page, the information stored in the fields is not manipulated in any way.
Also the bubble animation on the home page is an aftertought, my girlfriend rightly noted that the home page main body was too bland. I had been trying too hard to keep it simple. For the CSS on the bubbles transition, with its many prefixes, I ought to thank quackit.com, reference page: https://www.quackit.com/css/codes/marquees/.


## Using JS
I reluctantly used JS. I hadn't studied it yet, I was forced to investigate it on the internet to solve some problems, like activating the touch in place of hover on mobiles and a screen to cover the page while it is still loading.

## Other Pages
Once the template was made for the homepage, it wa relative easy to create the other pages. Still, it took one full day and a night. 
Here, the lessons learned while creating the home page where useful to center the contents of the elements vertically and horizontally quickly.


## Acknoledgments
A Special 'Thanks Honey' to my girlfriend Amy for providing texts and pictures, but especially for providing  the idea of Skin Care Website.
I must have scoured the whole internet for tips and instructions, I would never finish thanking if I was to enlist them all. The Code Institute Lessons, W3schools, StackOverflow, Limewire, Quackit were often looked up.
I Should have however point out that each solution found was somewhat not entirely fitting my case most of the time, nearly every suggestion took a lot of tweaking and/or integation with other sources, or where simply found not to be working.
