<h1>How to tell if your skin is oily:</h1>
<div class="bodyList">
<ul>
  <li>Your skin usually appears greasy later on in the day.</li>
  <li>Makeup products don't stay on.</li>
  <li>Pores are visibly enlarged, especially on your nose, chin and forehead.</li>
  <li>The oilier areas of your face have blackheads, pimples or other types of acne.</li>
  <li>You get frequent break outs of spots that always seem to come back.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1>Who gets oily skin?</h1>
<h3>Oily skin is typically hereditary – if you have oily skin, it’s probably because your parents had it too. But excess oil can also be the result of heightened hormone levels, poor diet, lack of sleep and exercise. Oily, acne-prone skin is most common in teenagers but can also occur in adults.</h3>
<h1>Pros?</h1>
<h3>If your oily skin is driving you crazy, there’s good news – those with oily skin types tend to have more moisture in their skin, making them less prone to premature wrinkles.  The key is to keeping the oiliness of your skin under control so you can put your best face forward.
